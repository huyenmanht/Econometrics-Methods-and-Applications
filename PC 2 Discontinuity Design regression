# Estimation

#4) R is the running variable (days before or after cut-off): R<=0 means before cut-off; R>0 means after cut-off
# define the variable z as 1 if born prior to age cut-off (such that R<=0) and 0 if born after age cut-off (such that R>0) for entering school
z=R<=0
z




#5) run RD estimation to estimate the effect of being born prior to age cut-off on mother's years of schooling by parametric RD
# assume constant slope before and after discontinuity
ols1=lm(mom_educ~z+R)
summary(ols1)



#6)assume different slope before and after discontinuity in RD design
ols2=lm(mom_educ~z*R)
summary(ols2)


#7) run RD estimation with controls for ethnicity: black, white_nh (white non-Hispanic), white_h (white Hispanic) 
sum(rbind(mean(black),mean(white_nh),mean(white_h)))
ols3=lm(mom_educ~z*R+black+white_nh+white_h)
summary(ols3)


#8) run a more local RD estimation without controls (allowing for different slope before and after cut-off)
localsample=(R>=-39 & R<=40)
sum(localsample)  #gives sample size

ols4=lm(mom_educ[localsample==1]~z[localsample==1]*R[localsample==1])
summary(ols4)

#9) plot mean outcomes of mom_educ given R (estimated by regressing outcomes on dummies defined by R) vs. running variable R in local sample  
plot(y=lm(mom_educ[localsample==1]~factor(R[localsample==1]))$fitted, x=R[localsample==1])


#==== Fuzzy RD==========

#10) generate a treatment variable based on mom's education: high education=more than 9 years of education 
# idea is to estimate the effect of mom's higher education on number of doctor visits prior to birth of child by using z as instrument in Fuzzy RD design 
higheduc=mom_educ>9

higheduc

#We can show probability of treatment by forcing variable (shows where we have first stage)
plot(aggregate(higheduc,list(R=R),mean),ylab="probability of high educ")

#11) investigate first stage effect of instrument z on treatment 
ols5=lm(higheduc~z+R)
summary(ols5)

#12) run fuzzy RD regression assuming constant slope in running variable
iv1=ivreg(numvisits ~ higheduc+R | z+R)
summary(iv1)

#13) run fuzzy RD regression assuming different slope in running variable before and after discontinuity
iv2=ivreg(numvisits ~ higheduc*R  | z*R)
summary(iv2)

#14) run fuzzy RD regression assuming different slope in running variable before and after discontinuity and include dummies for ethnicity
iv3=ivreg(numvisits ~ higheduc*R +black+white_nh+white_h  | z*R +black+white_nh+white_h)
summary(iv3)


#15) investigate first stage effect of instrument z on treatment in local sample
ols6=lm(higheduc[localsample==1] ~ z[localsample==1]+R[localsample==1])
summary(ols6)

#16) run fuzzy RD regression assuming different slope in running variable before and after discontinuity in local sample
iv4=ivreg(numvisits[localsample==1] ~ higheduc[localsample==1]*R[localsample==1] | z[localsample==1]*R[localsample==1])
