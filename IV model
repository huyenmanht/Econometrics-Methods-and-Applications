# Distribution of wage and educ. Does the data appear to be plausible?
# Explore missing values
sum(is.na(data_pc2)) #return the sum of missing observations in the dataset
sum(is.na(educ))
sum(is.na(wage))


#1) Distribution of wage and educ
summary(wage)
hist_wage=hist(wage,col="grey",main="Wage")

summary(educ)
hist_educ=hist(educ,col="dimgray",main="Education")

#2) Mean wage for each education level 
aggregate(wage,list(education=educ),mean)#split data into subsets
plot(aggregate(wage,list(education=educ),mean))

# We can show a two-way scatter plot with a fitted line, in addition 
plot(educ,wage,xlab="education",ylab="wage")
reg1=lm(wage~educ)
abline(reg1)
#we plotted a regression line 



# Estimation: homogeneous effects


#3) Estimate the returns to education by OLS
ols1=lm(lwage~educ)
summary(ols1)
#if we assume homoskedastic error terms
coeftest(ols1)
#the covariance btw u and educ might be different than 0, this can't be a causality relationship 
#there fore we can use an iv 
# fatheduc as an instrument(Z) for education
#4) Discuss whether or not this instrument is plausibly valid

#5) 	Look at the correlation of educ and fatheduc and obtain the first stage estimates. 
#Attention! missing observations 
sum(is.na(fatheduc)) #how many na we have: 685
#Generate missing indicator
ind=is.na(fatheduc)==1 #ind=1 if we have missing information in fatheduc
#Correlation (doesn't work when there is NA)
cor(educ[ind==0], fatheduc[ind==0]) #condition in the bracket: only for observation with no missing information
# output = 0.4692668

#first stage
fs1=lm(educ~fatheduc)
summary(fs1)
#ss1=lm(lwage~fs1$fitted) #will not run because of missing obeservation fatheuc 

# If we want to estimate 2SLS manually, we must account for missing observations in fatheduc
ss1=lm(lwage[ind==0]~fs1$fitted) #the command would not work if we don't exclude observations with missing information 
summary(ss1)

#Attention: Standard errors are not correct! -> use the ivreg

# Use iv command
iv1=ivreg(lwage~educ|fatheduc)
summary(iv1, vcov=vcovHC)

#6) Is your explanation in (5) plausible if you think that omitted variable bias from unobserved ability only was the problem for OLS?

#7) 	How could you increase the validity of the instrument with the available data?

# Perform a new IV regression of lwage on educ (Z=fatheduc) including the controls 

#8) Obtain again the first stage estimates 
#perform a new IV regression: add control variable south + black + smsa
#first stage: 
fs2=lm(educ~fatheduc+south+black+smsa)
summary(fs2)  

#9) Use 2SLS to estimate the model and compare the coefficient on educ 
iv2=ivreg(lwage~educ+south+black+smsa|fatheduc+south+black+smsa)
summary(iv2, vcov=vcovHC)

ols2=lm(lwage~educ+south+black+smsa)
summary(ols2)
coeftest(ols2, vcov=vcovHC)

#10) why growing up near a college could be a good instrument for education conditional on smsa, black and south?

#11)  Use nearc2 as instrument for educ 
iv3=ivreg(lwage~educ+south+black+smsa|nearc2+south+black+smsa)
summary(iv3, vcov=vcovHC)

#check assumption 1
cor(educ,nearc2)
#check stage 1 strength of instrument
fs3=lm(educ~nearc2+south+black+smsa)
summary(fs3) 

#12) Use nearc4 as instrument for education and repeat the 2SLS estimation and check the first stage
fs4=lm(educ~nearc4+south+black+smsa)
summary(fs4) 

iv4=ivreg(lwage~educ+south+black+smsa|nearc4+south+black+smsa)
summary(iv4, vcov=vcovHC)

#13) If fatheduc and nearc4 would both be valid instruments, would your results from (12) and (8) be possible?



# Heterogenous effects. Education= college education {0,1}


#14) collfath as an instrument
iv5=ivreg(lwage~college+south+black+smsa|collfath+south+black+smsa)
summary(iv5, vcov=vcovHC)

# nearc4 as an instrument
iv6=ivreg(lwage~college+south+black+smsa|nearc4+south+black+smsa)
summary(iv6, vcov=vcovHC)

#15) Estimate the size of the complier population for each instrument (ignoring the covariates)
olsA=lm(college~collfath)
#mean difference when the instrument is turned on and off
#1,1: dummy for collfath = 1, 1,0: dummy for collfath = 0 
meanA1=mean(cbind(1,1)%*%olsA$coef)
meanA2=mean(cbind(1,0)%*%olsA$coef)
meanA1-meanA2 # = 0.39911

#or:
olsA=lm(college~collfath)

summary(olsA)
#coef = 0.39911

#for nearc4
olsB=lm(college~nearc4)
meanB1=mean(cbind(1,1)%*%olsB$coef)
meanB2=mean(cbind(1,0)%*%olsB$coef)
meanB1-meanB2

#or:
summary(olsB)
